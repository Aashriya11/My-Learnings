Benefits of visualization:
* It helps us to convey the right message to the audience through visuals.
* It helps us find outliers in our data.
* It helps the business leader to take an accurate decision.
* It helps us to understand how the data is distributed over time.

These are the type of messages, that we usually send out when we’re creating impactful visualizations in business.
Message Type -> Comparision
             -> Distribution
             -> Breakup of a whole
             -> Relationship
             -> Trends

Different kinds of Charts and their usage:
1. Comparison Chart: 
* In this chart, we compare one value with the other.
* Use the following charts to represent it: Column Chart, Bar Chart, Line Chart, Scatter Chart.
* Example: Region-wise sales, economy rate comparison of bowlers.

 > Column Charts: (vertical rectangle)
 * It is used to compare values across multiple categories.
 * X-axis: Categories & Y-axis: Values
 * In the column charts, you can also show information about parts of a whole across different categories, and you can show this in absolute value as well as relative terms. Here comes the concept of a stacked column chart and 100% stacked column charts.

 > Bar Charts: 
 * Bar chart is quite similar with Column chart.
 * The only difference between them, X-axis: Values & Y-axis: Categories
 * When duration or category text is long, we use bar graph.
 * Stacked bar charts are used to compare parts of a whole(relative and absolute) and compare change over categories or time.

   Note: Absolute: which is universal truth, regardless of any perception, Relative: which change according to the observers point of view.

 > Line Charts:
 * One of the most popular charts used in industries.
 * Example: Analyzing sales data, YoY profit/trend, person's salary increases in the last year, use to show trends over time or categories.
 * X-axis: Categories & Y-axis: Values

 > Scatter Plots: 
 * An XY(Scatter) chart uses numerical values along both axes.
 * Scatter plots are useful for showing a correlation between the data points that may not be easy to see from the data alone.
 * It is used for displaying and comparing numerical values, such as scientific or statistical data.

2. Distribution Chart:
* To show the spread of data values over categorical or continuos values.
* Use the following charts to represent it: Histogram, Boxplot, KDE plot
* Example: Distributions of bugs found in 10 weeks of software testing phase.

 > Histogram:
 * It is used to graphing the frequency over a distribution. It is a very useful graph in the analytics world.
 * Visually, all the bars are touching each other with no space between them.

   Note: frequency refers to the number of times a specific event, value, or category occurs within a dataset.

 > Box Plot:
 * It is also known as Box and whiskers plot.
 * The line in the middle of the box is the median value. This means that 50% of the data are above the median value and 50% of the data are below the median value.
 * Medians are useful because they’re not swayed by outliers as mean is.
 * By using this plot, we can easily spot outliers and the distribution of the plot.

   Note: the mean is the average (sum divided by count), sensitive to extreme values, while the median is the middle value in a sorted list.

 > KDE Plot: (Kernal Density Estimation Plot)
 * It's a smooth form of Histogram/analogous to a histogram.
 * When we are drawing multiple distributions, it is preferred to use KDE plot over Histogram as it is less clusttered and more interpretable.

   Note: analogus- similar in some way; that you can compare.

3. The breakup of a whole chart:
* To analyze, how various parts comprise the whole.
* Use the following charts to represent it: Pie Chart, Donut Chart, Stacked Column Chart, Stacked Bar Chart.
* Example: Revenue contribution by different regions, the batsman scored on which sides of the ground.

 > Pie Chart:
 * If we want to represent your categorical data as part of the whole, then we should use a pie chart.
 * Each slice represents the percentage that the given category occupies out of the whole.
 * It’s better to use a pie chart if we’re having less than 5 categories.

 > Donut Chart:
 * It is a variant of a pie chart, with the hole in the center.
 * It displays the categories as arcs rather than slices.

 > Stacked Column/Bar Chart:
 * A Stacked chart is used when want to show the relative percentage of multiple data series in stacked columns/bar, the total (cumulative) of stacked columns/bar always equals 100%.
 * The 100% stacked chart can show the part-to-whole proportions over time, for example, the proportion of quarterly sales per region or the proportion of monthly mortgage payment that goes toward interest vs. principal.

4. Relationship Chart:
* To show the relationship between two variables.
* Use the following charts to represent it: Scatter Plot, Line Chart.
* Example: Relationship between strategic breaks and batsman dismissal.

 > Scatter Plot: 
 * A scatter chart uses numerical values along both axes.
 * It uses dots to represent the values for two different numerical values.
 * It is useful for showing a correlation between the data points that may not be easy to see from the data alone.
 * It is used for displaying and comparing numerical values, such as scientific or statistical data.

 > Line Chart:
 * As discussed above, a line chart is also used to find the relationship between the two variables.

5. Trend Chart:
* To show trends over time, it is also termed as "Time Series Data".
* Use the following charts to represent it: Line Chart, Area Chart, Column Chart.
* Example: Hourly temperature variation during a day, Run rate tracker over by over.

 > Line Chart:
 * The best way to visualise trend data is by line chart, use to see trends in various domains.
 
 > Area Chart: 
 * It is used to see magnitude of values.
 * It shows the relative importance of values over the time.
 * It is similar to a line chart, but because the area between lines is filled in, the area chart emphasizes the magnitude of values more than the line chart does.

 > Column Chart:
 * A column chart as discussed above is also used to show the trends of values over time and categories.

   Note: "magnitude of values" refers to their size, amount, or strength, essentially how far they are from zero, disregarding direction or sign.
